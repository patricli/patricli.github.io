# Check out O11yfest 2022!

o11yfest is a multi-day virtual technology conference focused on empowering DevOps practitioners with solutions that improve observability over systems and processes.

## Why is o11yfest around?

The conference is designed to promote awareness in OpenTelemetry and other relevant projects and techniques related to increasing visibility, transparency, and traceability of mission-critical data across software teams. o11yfest is in its third year of operation as a grass-roots event whose aim is to encourage sharing of knowledge and development of the discipline of observability engineering.

## What’s Different between 2021 and 2022

In its first year, Observe 20/20 hosted hundreds of practitioners and community members and subsequently transformed into o11yfest 2021. As point-in-time events, this was great, but organizers also feel that it is important to grow this into reoccurring community events.

This year, we’re doubling up on our o11yfest community to reflect this intent, and hope to hold multiple future events throughout 2022 and beyond under the ‘o11yfest’ umbrella.

## Why is o11yfest [still] Virtual?

Our organizers feel that during our current COVID restrictions, we are responsible to plan an event which does not over-commit attendees or over-promise sponsors to logistics that would put anyone at risk. This decision is not easy since, at it’s earliest conception in late 2019, the event has always intended to ‘bring people together’ in meaningful ways. Unfortunately for all of us, this is not physically plausible, despite other conferences making decisions around physical presence and logistics.

We are committed to safety and equity for the whole community and a virtual event still seems the best way to make sure of this in 2022.

# Agile Book Club: Refactoring (with James Shore and Martin Fowler)

James Shore's Art of Agile Development is a favorite single-volume book on agile software development. A reason for that is its serious emphasis on the technical practices that are essential to making it work effectively. James and Martin discuss the role of refactoring for software development, the nature of design changes we see, and how to break down big changes into small pieces.

# Top Book Recommendations

Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code *by Martin Fowler, with Kent Beck*
The guide to how to transform code with safe and rapid process, vital to keeping it cheap and easy to modify for future needs.

Service Design Patterns: Fundamental Design Solutions for SOAP/WSDL and RESTful Web Services *by Robert Daigneau, with Ian Robinson*
One of the inevitable truisms of enterprise applications is that they are not islands. You may be focused on solving a particular business problem, but in order to do that you won't be able to capture all the data you need yourself, or develop all the processing. Even if you had the time, that data and processing is being done elsewhere, duplication is both wasteful and leads to messy inconsistencies. As a result almost all enterprise applications need to communicate with other applications. These foreign systems are often not in the same organization, but provided by some third-party organization.

Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases through Build, Test, and Deployment Automation *by Jez Humble and David Farley*
Dave and Jez have been part of that sea-change, actively involved in projects that have built a culture of frequent, reliable deliveries. They and our colleagues have taken organizations that struggled to deploy software once a year, into the world of Continuous Delivery, where releasing becomes routine.

The foundation for the approach, at least for the development team, is Continuous Integration (CI). CI keeps a development team in sync with each other, removing the delays due to integration issues. A couple of years ago Paul Duvall wrote the book on CI within this series. But CI is just the first step. Software that's been successfully integrated into a mainline code stream still isn't software that's out in production doing its job. Dave and Jez's book pick up the story from CI to deal with that 'last mile', describing how to build the deployment pipelines that turn integrated code into production software.
